---------
*Release date: 2016-06-24*

    .. note::

        **This release include breaking changes to the API**

        - Dropped support for Python 2.6, Django 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7
        - Will follow `Haystack's <https://github.com/django-haystack/django-haystack#requirements>`_ supported versions


    - Removed deprecated ``SQHighlighterMixin``.
    - Removed redundant ``BaseHaystackGEOSpatialFilter``. If name of ``indexes.LocationField`` needs to be changed, subclass the ``HaystackGEOSpatialFilter`` directly.
    - Reworked filters:
        - More consistent naming of methods.
        - All filters follow the same logic for building and applying filters and exclusions.
        - All filter classes use a ``QueryBuilder`` class for working out validation and building queries which are to be passed to the ``SearchQuerySet``.
        - Most filters does *not* inherit from ``HaystackFilter`` anymore (except ``HaystackAutocompleteFilter`` and ``HaystackHighlightFilter``) and will no longer do basic field filtering. Filters should be properly placed in the ``filter_backends`` class attribute in their respective order to be applied. This solves issues where inherited filters responds to query parameters they should ignore.
    - HaystackFacetSerializer ``narrow_url`` now returns an absolute url.
    - HaystackFacetSerializer now properly serializes ``MultiValueField`` and ``FacetMultiValueField`` items as a JSON Array.
    - ``HaystackGenericAPIView.get_object()`` optional ``model`` query parameter now requires a ``app_label.model`` instead of just the ``model``.
    - Extracted internal fields and serializer from the ``HaystackFacetSerializer`` in order to ease customization.
    - ``HaystackFacetSerializer`` now supports all three `builtin <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/pagination/#api-reference>`_ pagination classes, and a hook to support custom pagination classes.
    - Extracted the ``more-like-this`` detail route and ``facets`` list route from the generic HaystackViewSet.
        - Support for ``more-like-this`` is available as a :class:`drf_haystack.mixins.MoreLikeThisMixin` class.
        - Support for ``facets`` is available as a :class:`drf_haystack.mixins.FacetMixin` class.

v1.5.6
------
*Release date: 2015-12-02*

    - Fixed a bug where ``ignore_fields`` on ``HaystackSerializer`` did not work unless ``exclude`` evaluates
      to ``True``.
    - Removed ``elasticsearch`` from ``install_requires``. Elasticsearch should not be a mandatory requirement,
      since it's useless if not using Elasticsearch as backend.

v1.5.5
------
*Release date: 2015-10-31*

    - Added support for Django REST Framework 3.3.0 (Only for Python 2.7/Django 1.7 and above)
    - Locked elasticsearch < 2.0.0 (See :drf-issue:`29`)

v1.5.4
------
*Release date: 2015-10-08*

    - Added support for serializing faceted results. Closing :drf-issue:`27`.

v1.5.3
------
*Release date: 2015-10-05*

    - Added support for :ref:`faceting-label` (Github :drf-issue:`11`).

v1.5.2
------
*Release date: 2015-08-23*

    - Proper support for :ref:`multiple-indexes-label` (Github :drf-issue:`22`).
    - Experimental support for :ref:`term-boost-label` (This seems to have some issues upstreams,
      so unfortunately it does not really work as expected).
    - Support for negate in filters.

v1.5.1
------
*Release date: 2015-07-28*

    - Support for More Like This results (Github :drf-issue:`10`).
    - Deprecated ``SQHighlighterMixin`` in favor of ``HaystackHighlightFilter``.
    - ``HaystackGenericAPIView`` now returns 404 for detail views if more than one entry is found (Github :drf-issue:`19`).

v1.5.0
------
*Release date: 2015-06-29*

    - Added support for field lookups in queries, such as ``field__contains=foobar``.
      Check out `Haystack docs <https://django-haystack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/searchqueryset_api.html?highlight=field%20lookup#field-lookups>`_
      for details.
    - Added default ``permission_classes`` on ``HaystackGenericAPIView`` in order to avoid crash when
      using global permission classes on REST Framework. See :ref:`permissions-label` for details.

v1.4
----
*Release date: 2015-06-15*

    - Fixed issues for Geo spatial filtering on django-haystack v2.4.x with Elasticsearch.
    - A serializer class now accepts a list or tuple of ``ignore_field`` to bypass serialization.
    - Added support for Highlighting.

v1.3
----
*Release date: 2015-05-19*

    - ``HaystackGenericAPIView().get_object()`` now returns Http404 instead of an empty ``SearchQueryset``
      if no object is found. This mimics the behaviour from ``GenericAPIView().get_object()``.
    - Removed hard dependencies for ``geopy`` and ``libgeos`` (See Github :drf-issue:`5`). This means
      that if you want to use the ``HaystackGEOSpatialFilter``, you have to install these libraries
      manually.

v1.2
----
*Release date: 2015-03-23*

    - Fixed ``MissingDependency`` error when using another search backend than Elasticsearch.
    - Fixed converting distance to D object before filtering in HaystackGEOSpatialFilter.
    - Added Python 3 classifier.

v1.1
----
*Release date: 2015-02-16*

    - Full coverage (almost) test suite
    - Documentation
    - Beta release Development classifier

v1.0
----
*Release date: 2015-02-14*

    - Initial release.
